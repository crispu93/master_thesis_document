\chapter{Proposed solution (Graph Partitioning for Large Graphs)}
\label{Chapter3}
GNNs aim at learning node
representations by learning the similarities shared between
connected nodes. However, the expressive ability of a GNN
is highly dependent on the quality of node features

One of the principal limitations that GAP has is that it requires 

According to the original paper~\cite{deepwalk}, the DeepWalk algorithm consists of two main components: a random walk generator and an update procedure. 

In the first component, a random node $v_i$ is taken uniformly at random to be the root of a random walk $\mathcal W_{v_i}$ which in its turn samples recursively from the neighbors of the last visited vertex until the maximum length $\gamma$ is reached.

As specified by Perozzi et. al.~\citep{deepwalk}, their experiments suggest that the number of walks started per vertex should be greater or equal than $\gamma=30$, the latent dimension greater or equal than $d=64$, and they fixed the sensible values of $w=10$ for the window size, and $t=40$ for the walk length . Based on those recommendations, in the experiments carried out in~\citep{deepwalk_hyper}, and the computational needs of the problem to be solver, it was found convenient to set $\gamma=60$, $d=64$, $w=10$(good results with 15), and $t=60$ (good results with 80).


For the algorithm that is proposed here, the implementation by the Karate Club API~\cite{karateclub} was used.
