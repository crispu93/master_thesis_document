\chapter{Experimental Results}
\label{Chapter4}

\section{Technical details and implementation}
As specified by Perozzi et. al.~\cite{deepwalk}, their experiments suggest that the number of walks started per vertex should be greater or equal than $\gamma=30$, the latent dimension greater or equal than $d=64$, and they fixed the sensible values of $w=10$ for the window size, and $t=40$ for the walk length . Based on those recommendations, in the experiments carried out in~\cite{deepwalk_hyper}, and the computational needs of the problem to be solved, it was found convenient to set $\gamma=60$, $d=64$, $w=15$, and $t=80$.

Saving and manipulating only the adjacency lists instead of the whole adjacency matrix, is an important 

For the algorithm that is proposed here, the implementation by the Karate Club API~\cite{karateclub} was used.
The number of partitions was set to four differently from the original paper where three partitions were used. It was used this number of partitions to have a comparison point with the result in The Graph Partitioning archive. There, the number of partitions is always a power of $2$.

\section{Dataset}

    For the dataset used to train and test the algorithm "The Graph Partitioning Archive"~\cite{archive}
The graphs are in the standard format used by JOSTLE and METIS. A description of the format and the requirements can be found in~\cite{jostle}.

For the purposes of this research, the graphs contained in "The Graph Partitioning Archive" where categorized in one of the following categories according to their vertex cardinality: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tiny graphs: those with less than $10,000$ nodes,
    \item Small graphs: those with node size between $45,000$ and $75,000$ and,
    \item Medium graphs: those with at least $99,000$ nodes but no more than $500,000$.
\end{itemize}

Ask Luis: is there a word for graphs with size more than big
