Future work
extend to different problem statements, such as balanced graph partitioning with tolerance or weighted graph partitioning.
Study the real impact on choosing the way to extract the features and try different algorithms
look for new ways the algorithm relies only on topological graph's structure
To generalize the algorithm and code to construct graphs from the features
Explore new techniques for sampling
Build a generic graph construction

GraphSAGE still takes a lot of time to run on really large graphs

\section{Contributions}
while it remains an open problem and it still very unexplored, the problem of feature generation...
